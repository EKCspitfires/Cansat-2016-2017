@adgibbs
I am the Computing and Technology Specialist for STEM Learning. Working across the National STEM Learning Centre and ESERO-UK teams, I lead on computing curriculum resources, projects and CPD.

I have taught science, including Physics to A-Level, before becoming a curriculum leader in ICT. I then managed a City Learning Centre in my home town of Sheffield, and led secondary computing and ICT support for secondary schools in Sheffield LA.

Areas of interest include teaching programming and computer science, space robotics, and making use of computation to support learning across STEM.
