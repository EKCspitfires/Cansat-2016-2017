 * 
 * Well, the old GUI was spaghetti code, all packed into one class, using SWT. I've opted to restart, this time using Swing.
 * 
 * I'm basically back to the same stage I was at before, I need to work on filtering the InputStream into different Strings and ints, 
 * then displaying them in JLabels.
 * 
 * I'll need assistance with this, as I'm not sure how the fields of data will appear from the actual CanSat itself.
 * 
 * For now, it outputs any Serial input to the console.
